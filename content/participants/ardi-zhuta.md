Ardi Zhuta has a long career of hosting, starting from middle school with some festivals and concerts in North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania. His television career started at 21 Television. First he served in the morning show as a host and journalist. Later, he operated in the news department, covering social and cultural topics. These opportunities, lead him to host a show business show on afternoon broadcasts. 

During a short pause from television, Ardi continued presenting in different cultural activities in North Macedonia. He was part of Top Talent, a talent show in Albania for journalists and hosts. He reached the grand final; however, he came just short of winning. He was the first Albanian journalist and presenter from North Macedonia to reach that phase of the competition. 

Now, Ardi has returned to his roots and is co-hosting National Television Alsatâ€™s morning.
