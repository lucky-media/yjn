Albina Sefadini holds a BA degree in International Communication. Presently, she is working at the project ''Support to Electoral Reforms" at NYCM (National Youth Council of Macedonia).

The desire to learn and empower her personality has given her the ambition to participate and challenge herself in various courses, training, projects, and conferences, such as the Conference ‘’Bridge of the Future’’ in China (July 2019), “Spend a day with Macedonia’s Leading CEO’s”, #AmbassadorForaDay and "Artivism" the LEAD MK, a small-scale project organized and implemented by her.

Albina likes to work with a team that produces quality over quantity while respecting deadlines.

She knows how to stay calm under pressure, how to manage different situations, and how to thrive in a new and unknown environment.

Albina's curiosity and determination suit quite well with this new challenge she's about to face: Journalism.
