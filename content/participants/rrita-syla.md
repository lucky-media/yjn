Rrita holds a master’s degree in English Language and Literature from South East European University. She did her MA research at the University of Education in Heidelberg. Rrita has worked as a content writer, English teacher, and currently is freelancing as a social media consultant. 
Rrita was selected to participate in the Foreign National Student Internship Program (FNSIP) by the U. S. Embassy of North Republic of Macedonia, where she did an internship as a Digital Media Intern in the Public Affairs Section. Throughout the course of her internship, she gained experience in op-eds and published an op-ed that tackled the problem of bribery in the health care system. 
Rrita’s personality reflects creativity, eagerness for new information, curiosity, and a strong desire to learn and enrich herself professionally. She considers herself as a critical media consumer who loves research, writing, and topics that challenge taboos. Her nickname ‘’colorrita’ speaks volumes about her personality. She does not see the world in ''black '' and ''white''. Rrita embraces the complexities with open-mindedness and sees the spectrum instead of focusing just on a certain side.
