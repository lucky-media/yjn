Rita Behadini has always had a passion about journalism. From her time as a high school student engagement in issues that affect our lives has been important for her. Feeling the need for action in present times she started writing original pieces. Although this was not particularly journalism related, it motivated and inspired her to continue in the path of journalism. The experiences gained during this time, whether they were learning to understand people or the critiques from professors, have been invaluable to the further development of her journalistic abilities. 

Her studies continued in the South Eastern European University. Here she worked further on expressing herself. During her time in this university her work was centered around gender equality, which allowed further expansion of her knowledge in the field of journalism. This environment presented challenges which she recognizes that have had positive effects on the further development of the patience and unbiased reporting required of a journalist. 

During her time in university, She was hired as a journalist for Portalb.mk. After a year, she decided to take a work opportunity to be a presenter of the morning show on Alsat-M Television. Some of her most important work as a journalist has not only been focused on gender equality but environmental issues, the most important being the one concerning Sunny Hill in Tetovo. Through the extensive work with these issues her knowledge and abilities have expanded. She will continue to work on any issue that is relevant to the people who need it most, and report in an unprejudiced manner about the challenges we all are presented with.
