Ardit Ramadani has a bachelor degree in LAW; nevertheless, he has been working as a journalist since the age of 17. He embarked on journalism by working the first two years as an intern in an online media called “ShqipMedia”, where he was later promoted and hired. During this internship, he also volunteered at a local non-governmental organization “Multikultura”, which lead him to write for an online media known as “Bon Zo”.

During his freshmen years of college, Ardit was the co-founder of a Feminist Movement, where he was the coordinator of many projects related to human rights.Ardit also served as a senator at the Student Parliament and Association, where he raised some important issues toward students’ rights. He used this position to push for further reforms, fighting against negative phenomena in North Macedonia’s educational system, such as corrupt professors asking for sexual favors and political influence in student organizations.

Currently, Ardit is working as a full-time journalist at a very credible medium www.Portalb.mk, based in Skopje, where he covers different topics and at the same time is one of the coordinators of a movement which is in the process of becoming (formally) a nonprofit organization, “Center for Equal Oportunities- CEO).
